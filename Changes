Revision history for Perl extension IPC::System::Simple.

{{NEXT}}
        * Silence "Statement unlikely to be reached" warning (Karen Etheridge)

1.21  Tue Mar 23 12:08:47 AUSEST 2010
        * TEST: t/win32.t has more sane handling of skipped and
          unimplimented tests.

        * TEST: Author tests no longer leave the permissions of
          not_an_exe.txt permanently changed.

        * BUGFIX: capture/capturex no longer break STDOUT when
          running an unknown command under Windows.  Many thanks
          to Jan Krynicky for a fix.  (RT #48319)

        * BUILD: Upgraded to Module::Install 0.93.

1.20  Sat Jan  9 15:08:41 AUSEST 2010

        * TEST: t/win32.t no longer claims to have more tests than
          it really has.  This fixes an install issue under Windows.
          RT #53124.  Thanks to Erez Schatz and Curtis Jewell for
          spotting this.

1.19  Fri Dec  4 14:14:25 AUSEST 2009

        * TEST: Added tests to ensure correct behaviour when
          calling commands in Windows which are contained in directories
          that contain spaces. (These tests are currently skiped,
          as they're testing for a known bug.)

        * BUGFIX: Spurious warnings about redefining POSIX macros
          no longer plague Windows systems.

1.18  Sun Feb  8 19:09:15 AUSEDT 2009

        * BUGFIX: IPC::System::Simple should now compile cleanly
          under 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 (as well as 5.6.2+).  Many thanks
          to David Golden for spotting this bug.  (RT #43098)

        * DOCUMENTATION: "Advanced" is now spelt correctly under
          in the section "Advanced Usage".  Many thanks to
          Raymond Wan for spotting this typo.  (RT #42705)

1.17  Fri Dec 19 00:45:16 AUSEDT 2008
        * TEST: Tests to ensure that passing undefined values to
          systemx() do not produce malformed errors, but instead
          well-formed errors.  Many thanks to Nadim Khemir for
          spotting this.  RT #41149.

        * BUGFIX: Workaround for a bug under Perl 5.10 where on
          some platforms coredumps were not being reported in $?.
          Many thanks to the Debian Perl folks for finding this,
          particularly Gregor Herrmann.

        * TEST: Better diagnostics from t/08_core.t.

        * TEST: t/08_core.t now cleans up its core files after running.
          Thanks to Gregor Herrmann for spotting this.

        * TEST: t/08_core.t is now a main test, rather than an
          author-only test.

        * BUGFIX: Attempting to call an undefined command is now
          a fatal error.

        * VERSION: Since ISS is now very stable, and provides a
          significantly improved interface to the default system()
          command, the major version number has been incremented.

          There are no incompatible changes with previous version.
          The increment of the major version number is to indicate
          stability only.

0.16  Sun Sep 14 11:29:17 AUSEST 2008
        * DOCUMENTATION: Updated documentation on $EXITVAL to provide
          extra clarification.  Many thanks again to Elliot Shank
          for the feedback!

        * DOCUMENTATION: Noted that run() and system() are aliases for each
          other.  Thanks again for Elliot Shank for the feedback.

        * DOCUMENTATION: Fixed a few missing double-quotes in the
          systemx() documentation.  Thanks to Andrew Dent for spotting these!

        * DOCUMENTATION: Added a feedback section.  If you find this module
          useful, consider rating it at

        - Added systemx() and capturex() that _never_ invoke the

          zero-length environment strings.
        - Updated taint checks to always run on 5.6.x, under

0.07  Sat Apr 12 11:57:28 AEST 2008
        - Changed tests to use SIGKILL rather than SIGINT to avoid
          complications on systems where SIGINT is masked.

          to Jon Swartz for spotting these.

0.04  Mon Oct 30 15:14:53 AEST 2006
